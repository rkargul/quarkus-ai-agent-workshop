# Bonus 3 - Your own use case

Think of a use case you would like to implement.
You can use an LLM to help you!

For example a personal assistant that can help you with your daily tasks.


Sketch out the idea:

- What external systems do you need to interact with?
  - Calendar
  - Weather
  - ...
- Do you interact with a database?
- What are the steps of the use case?

Start by designing the use case and add a little diagram.

Next generate a new Quarkus project on [code.quarkus.io](https://code.quarkus.io/) and select the extensions you need.
Start coding!
